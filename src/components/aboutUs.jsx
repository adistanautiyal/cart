        yourselves.

      <h2>A Thriving Intra-College Marketplace</h2>

        have textbooks, handcrafted art, or gently-used clothes, KaizenCart
        offers a platform to connect with potential buyers. This fosters a
        vibrant internal marketplace, promoting sustainable consumption and
        eliminating the need for external vendors.

        owner, is dedicated to continuous improvement based on user feedback.
        The platform's core functionalities can be adapted to cater to a wider
        audience, potentially evolving into a city or even nationwide student
        marketplace.
